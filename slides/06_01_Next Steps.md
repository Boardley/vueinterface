Hey there, it's Ray again... Thanks for watching this course.

Angular.js is a really exciting framework that can really help you build your applications faster. There's a lot of really good resources on the web you should check out.

The first place you should go is the firebase website at this URL (https://firebase.google.com/)
https://www.youtube.com/user/Firebase

In addition to being a real time database and providing authentication. Firebase has grown to include Storage, Hosting and Analytics.

Firebase uses a special service for working with AngularJS called AngularFire. If you want to build AngularJS applications with firebase, make sure your study up on the documentation, which you can find here. https://github.com/firebase/angularFire

Firebase has a number of excellent training videos on other topics with the great David East, which you can find on their YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/Firebase.

We've got lots of other AngularJS courses in the library so make sure you do a search for AngularJS.

If you want to learn more about me, you can reach me at my personal site raybo.org or through twitter, github, linkedIn or about any other social media network @planetoftheweb.

Once again thanks for watching this course...and don't stop learning.
