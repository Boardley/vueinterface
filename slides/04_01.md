# Vue.js Interface
Creating a Modular App

>> Author Notes: A common technique in dynamic apps is to manage your styles as people interact with your content. To do that, we're going to need to examing how you can bind classes and styles to your code as well as generate events that can act on those bindings.

## Class and Style Bindings

- `v-bind:style = "someStyles"`
- `v-bind:class = "{ someClass: bool } "`
- Boolean can be a `var`

>> Author Notes: You can add classes to your code in a few different ways

1. For example, you can bind a style to an element by using v-bind:style or just :style,  and that lets you add an object full of style attributes or an array of variables that have styles. That isn't always useful because most of the time, you'll want to just create classes for styles, although this way of doing thing allows for some programatic effects like modifying a style property based on variable. If you want to learn more about binding elements to the style attributes, we've got a great video you can check out at [this URL](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-vue-js/binding-to-the-class-attribute).

2. Another way to do this, which most of the time is cleaner is to just create a style and then turn it on or off or base it on style variables.

3. The boolean here can be a variable that I can modify to add and remove this class dynamically.

I'm going to create some code to allow us to add an appointment and then I'll use this to let users toggle this window on and off. Binding styles can get a bit complicated, so if you want to look at a deeper dive into binding classes, take a look at this video.
