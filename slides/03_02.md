# Vue.js Interface
Nested Sub-components

>> Author Notes: As our applications grow to be more complex, sometimes we need to create even further sub-components. Let's take a look at how that works.

## App Structure

```
<main>
  <add-appointment>
  <search-appointments>
  <appointment-list>
    <appointment-list-item />
    <appointment-list-item />
  <appointment-list>
</main>
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" contenteditable="true" style="width: 40%;" -->

>> Author Notes:

Our application is going to have another level of complexity so that each list item is a separate component, this will give you a good idea of how to assemble more complex apps, plus it's good for you to get more practice working with components.
